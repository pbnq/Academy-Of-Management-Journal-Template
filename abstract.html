<div><span>This Authorea document template can be used to prepare documents according to a desired citation style and authoring guidelines. Abstracts are not always required, but most academic papers have one
and writers should know how to produce a useful abstract. An abstract
should be a very short, clear and concise summation of the entire paper.
An abstract should provide enough of a preview that a typical reader will
know whether or not they wish to read the paper. It should reveal both
the purpose and conclusions of the paper.</span><br></div>
