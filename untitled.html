<div>This Authorea document template can be used to prepare documents according to a desired citation style and authoring guidelines. Abstracts are not always required, but most academic papers have one and writers should know how to produce a useful abstract. An abstract should be a very short, clear and concise summation of the entire paper.</div><div>An abstract should provide enough of a preview that a typical reader will know whether or not they wish to read the paper. It should reveal both the purpose and conclusions of the paper.</div><div></div><h1 id="auto-label-section-226136" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>The format of this template follows a typical journal publication with an <b>introduction</b>, <b>results</b> and <b>conclusion</b>. Examples of an equation, list and citation are also included.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2 id="auto-label-subsection-616396" class="ltx_title_subsection">The purpose of the introduction</h2><div>Most academic introductions follow an ‘inverted pyramid’ structure: they start broad and narrow down to a specific thesis or research question. The introduction should reveal:</div><ol><li>some broad knowledge of the overall topic</li><li>references to related and prior work in the field of investigation</li><li>succinct overview of the major point of the paper</li></ol><div></div><h1 id="auto-label-section-330806" class="ltx_title_section">Results</h1><div>This section is only included in papers that rely on primary research. This section catalogues the results of the experiment. The results should be presented in a clear and unbiased way. Most results sections will contain <a href="https://authorea.com" target="_blank">links</a>&nbsp;and citations, e.g.,&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Feynman_1986}</cite>, and equations, e.g.&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(e^{i\pi}+1=0\)</span>.</div><div></div><h1 id="auto-label-section-226071" class="ltx_title_section">Conclusion</h1><div>The conclusion should reinforce the major claims or interpretation in a way that is not mere summary. The writer should try to indicate the significance of the major claim/interpretation beyond the scope of the paper but within the parameters of the field. The writer might also present complications the study illustrates or suggest further research the study indicates is necessary.</div>
